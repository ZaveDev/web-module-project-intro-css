    <p> Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the 
      power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>
    <br>
    <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but 
      within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient 
      giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it 
        interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for 
        <span id="bold">current fire restrictions</span>.</p>

      <p>We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can pay the park entrance fee upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).</p>
